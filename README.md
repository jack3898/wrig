# Wrig lang interpreter

If you take the "ht" out of my surname, you get "Wrig". ðŸ˜‚

This is a personal project guided by the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Rob Nystrom. He has a free web version of the book, however I have purchased the physical copy for myself as it is really well written!

This project will have heavy resemblance to the book, but I will be adding my own twist to it in addition to it being written in Rust and the book's examples being written in Java. There are some unique paradigm differences between the two languages, so sometimes I need to be creative in how I implement the examples.

This project should also be quite different to other Rust implementations of the book you can find online as I aim to not copy how someone else has done it verbatim and instead try to understand the concepts and implement them in my own way.

This project will cover the first part of the book, which is the interpreter. The second part of the book is the compiler, which I will also be implementing in Rust but probably in another repo from scratch.
